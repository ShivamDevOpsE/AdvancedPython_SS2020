University of Regensburg - Summer Semester 2020 Exercises

Hii, Shivam here, enthusiast to do some work in Python,
Uploading the exercise of Convay's Game of Life just for demo.

Introduction:

The game of life is a game in the mathematical sense rather than a playable game. It is “zero player game”.
The game takes place on a two-dimensional finite or infinite grid whose cells can take two distinct states: “alive” or “dead”.

At each stage, the evolution of a cell is entirely determined by its current state and the state of its eight neighbours as follows:
1) A dead cell with exactly three living neighbours becomes alive.
2) A living cell with two or three living neighbours remains alive.
3) In all other cases, the cell becomes (or remains) dead.
